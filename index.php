		<div style="line-height: 25px; font-size:20px;padding-top:35px">
		<p>
		An inventory management system (IMS) helps businesses manage their inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. It can also be used to create receipts, work-orders, bill of materials, and other documents. An IMS can track goods and resources throughout their life cycle, allowing companies to identify bottlenecks and fix issues before they start to accumulate.
		</p>
		<p>
		The mission of an IMS is to provide a central repository of information used to define assets and relate them to their owner, location, and relative importance. This information provides personnel with data needed to support their job functions.

	<h3 style="color:#3c43a4;"><strong>Why is inventory management important? </strong> </h3>
		<div style="line-height: 25px; font-size:20px;padding-top:35px">
		<p>
		One of the most valuable assets of a company is its inventory. In various industries, such as retail, food services, and manufacturing, a lack of inventory can have detrimental effects. Aside from being a liability, inventory can also be considered a risk. It can be prone to theft, damage, and spoilage. Having a large inventory can also lead to a reduction in sales.
			</p>
		<p>
		Both for small businesses and big corporations, having a proper inventory management system is very important for any business. It can help you keep track of all your supplies and determine the exact prices. It can also help you manage sudden changes in demand without sacrificing customer experience or product quality. This is especially important for brands looking to become a more customer-centric organization. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Balancing the risks of overstocks and shortages is an especially challenging process for companies with complex supply chains. A company's inventory is typically a current asset that it plans to sell within a year. It must be measured and counted regularly to be considered a current asset. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The goal of any good inventory management system is to help warehouse managers keep track of the stock levels of their products. This means allowing them full transparency into their chain to monitor the flow of goods from their supplier. 

The benefits are both operational and financial. Not only will it serve to improve performance, but itâ€™s also useful for preventing theft with the help of product tracking and security.
